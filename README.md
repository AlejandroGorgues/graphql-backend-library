# graphql-backend-library
This repository contains the code to run the library backend application developed based on the guide of [fullstackopen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) free course of the Helsinki University.

The purpose of this backend is to use graphql with Apollo alongside mongodb for data and user management.
## Extra
* MongoDB has been the default cloud DB.
* User need to be created to interact fully with the [frontend](https://github.com/AlejandroGorgues/graphql-frontend-library.git)
